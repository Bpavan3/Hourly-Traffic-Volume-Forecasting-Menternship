# Develop a Predictive Model to Accurately Forecast Hourly Traffic Volumes at Different Road Junctions

## Menternship Project (Uber × mentormind.in)

### Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a mentor-led internship offered by Uber
in collaboration with mentormind.in. The objective was to develop a predictive
model to forecast hourly traffic volumes at multiple road junctions using
historical traffic data.

### Duration
- Start Date: Dec 01, 2025
- End Date: Jan 15, 2026

### Objectives
- Analyze historical traffic patterns
- Identify peak and off-peak traffic hours
- Study temporal trends in traffic flow
- Build a predictive model for hourly traffic volume forecasting

### Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (time-based features)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Traffic pattern analysis
- Predictive modeling and evaluation

### Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

### Repository Contents
